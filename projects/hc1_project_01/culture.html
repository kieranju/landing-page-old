                <h3>pretext</h3>
                    <p>Canadian culture is a term that embodies the artistic, musical, literary, culinary, political and social elements that are representative of Canada and Canadians, to not only its own population, but also people all over the world. Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and traditions, especially British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures. Over time, elements of the cultures of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated into mainstream Canadian culture. Immigrant and Aboriginal customs have combined to form a unique blend of art, cuisine, literature, humour and music. The population has also been influenced by American culture because of a shared language, proximity and migration between the two countries.</p>

                    <h3>historical influences</h3>
                    <p>For tens of thousands of years, Canada was inhabited by Aboriginal peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings. The legacies of these peoples, especially noticeable in food, sports, and place-names, remained strong throughout the colonial period and continue to be important in contemporary Canada. Although not without conflict and bloodshed, early European interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations in what is now Canada were relatively peaceful, compared to the experience of native peoples in the United States. Combined with late economic development in many regions, this comparably nonbelligerent history has allowed Aboriginal Canadians to have a lasting influence on the national culture while preserving their own identity (see: The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples). Over the course of three centuries, countless North American Indigenous words, inventions, concepts, and games have become an everyday part of Canadian language and use. Many places in Canada, both natural features and human habitations, use indigenous names. The name "Canada" itself derives from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word meaning "village" or "settlement". The name of Canada's capital city Ottawa comes from the Algonquin language term "adawe" meaning "to trade".</p>
        
                    <p>Most of Canada's territory was inhabited by European settlers later than other European colonies in the Americas, with the result that themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of modern Canadian culture. The French originally settled New France along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and Saint Lawrence River during the early part of the 17th century. The British conquest of Canada and subsequent immigration, during the mid-18th century brought the large Francophone population under British rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation, while the migration of 46,000 United Empire Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies brought American influences which gave the Canadian provinces a distinct American flavor until the Great Migration of Canada (1815 to 1850) from the British Isles. Canada until the 1940s saw itself in terms of English and French cultural, linguistic and political identities, and to some extent aboriginal.</p>
